# 👋 Hey, I'm Hussien Ghaddar

I'm a computer science student and full-stack developer who enjoys building real applications — from full-featured social platforms to APIs, Angular apps, and scalable backend systems.  

I focus on clean architecture, real-time features, and writing code that other humans can actually read.  
Currently sharpening my backend skills through hands-on Laravel development and continuous project work.
